# Web_Form_Automation_By_JUnit_Using_Selenium

## What are Selenium and JUnit:

**Selenium** is a free (open source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python, etc to create Selenium Test Scripts. Testing done using the Selenium testing tool is usually referred to as **Selenium Testing**.

Selenium automates web browsers. It is most famous for enabling rapid, repeatable web app testing, which allows developers to ship new releases faster and with confidence.

Most programmers and developers who build website applications and wish to test them every now and then use Selenium. One of the biggest advantages of Selenium, which has made it so popular, is its flexibility. Any individual who creates web programs can use Selenium to test the code and applications. Further, professionals can debug and perform visual regression tests as per the requirements of the website or code.

In most organizations, it is the job of quality analyst (QA) engineers to test web applications by using Selenium. They are required to write scripts that can help in maximizing accuracy and test coverage to make changes in the project and maintain the infrastructure of the test.

**JUnit** is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit, that originated with JUnit. It is useful for Java Developers to write and run repeatable tests. In Java, there are test cases that have to be re-executed every time a new code is added. This is done to make sure that nothing in the code is broken. 

JUnit has several graphs that represent the progress of a test. When the test runs smoothly, the graph displays a green color, and it turns red if the test fails. JUnit Testing enables developers to develop highly reliable and bug-free code. JUnit has set a benchmark when it comes to testing Java applications. Since JUnit is compatible with almost all IDEs, organizations worldwide have adopted it to perform unit testing in the Java Programming Language.

JUnit Testing enables developers to develop highly reliable and bug-free code. JUnit plays a huge role when it comes to regression testing. Regression Testing is a type of software testing that checks if the recent changes made to the code do not adversely affect the previously written code.
